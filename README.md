I'm relatively new to the world of programming.  It all started when I took an Excel class in college for my Business minor, 
and found myself surprisingly enthralled with the software.  From there I discovered VBA programming,
which I utilized at my job where I automated my coworkers' procedures to drastically cut down on our workload.

Throughout that process my passion for coding made itself abundantly clear,
and I've made various projects as a means of building my skills,
and just to make software that's convenient to me.

My repositories contain a number of these projects, and I hope to keep adding more as I grow.
